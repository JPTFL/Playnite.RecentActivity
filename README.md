## Requirements
The [GameActivity](https://github.com/Lacro59/playnite-gameactivity-plugin) extension is required for this plugin.

# Thanks
The logic to retrieve the activity data from the GameActivity extension is mostly copied and heavily inspired
from the [YearInReview](https://github.com/SparrowBrain/Playnite.YearInReview) extension by 
[SparrowBrain](https://github.com/SparrowBrain).

Thank you very much for the great work!
